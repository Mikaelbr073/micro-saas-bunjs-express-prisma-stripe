# Micro-saas 
This micro-saas was used to develop the skills of working with the largest stripe 
payment gateway in the world.

In this saas, a TODO application was developed, where the user could register up to 5 free tasks, and then would have to complete the payment process to register activities without limitations.

#### Stripe

Additionally, you need to create an account on Stripe and create your access keys. in the project index with the name "config.ts"

```javascript
export const config = {
    stripe: {
        publishableKey: 'your publishable Key',
        secretKey: 'your secret key',
        proPriceId: 'your priceid',
        webhookScret: 'your webhook Scret'
    }
}
```

Then you need to install a stripe CLI to run locally

Then you need to configure the webhook to test the application
